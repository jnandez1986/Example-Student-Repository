#TOY GIVE AWAY

Hello my name is Jorge Hernandez. I would like to know if you are interested in hosting a small toy giveaway for children. The manager will need to put a box or container just outside or inside the  restaurant, and ask customers to donate a toy for charity. There can be a sign to let the customers know the exact date of the donation. Toys for Tots can make a pick up upon request or the toys can be droped off in many locations. You are probably asking yourself why I chose you. Since you like making people happy after a delicious meal, I thought you might like to pass on a message of hope to youngsters less fortunate  and make a difference.

If you would like more information please email me at <jnandez1986@yahoo.com>

Thank you for your time,

Jorge Hernandez
